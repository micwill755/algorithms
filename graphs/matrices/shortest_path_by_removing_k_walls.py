'''
Shortest path by removing K walls
Last Updated : 23 Feb, 2023
Given a 2D binary matrix of size N * M, where 0 represents an empty space while 1 represents a wall you cannot walk through. You are also given an integer K. You can walk up, down, left, or right. Given that you can remove up to K walls, return the minimum number of steps to walk from the top left corner (0, 0) to the bottom right corner (N-1, M-1). 

Note: If there is no way to walk from the top left corner to the bottom right corner, return -1.

Examples:


Input: N = 3, M = 3, K = 1
mat = {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 1}, {0, 1, 0}}
Output: 4
Explanation: We can remove any one of the walls and reach the bottom in 4 moves.

The below image gives the paths through which we can go from the source to the destination

If we carefully observe the paths shown above then, we will see that in these paths we have one cell that contains 1 and since we have k=1 hence we can traverse this cell also, and hence it gives the minimum steps.

Input: N = 2, M = 2, K = 0
mat[] = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}}
Output: -1
Explanation: Thereâ€™s no way of reaching the bottom corner without removing any walls.
